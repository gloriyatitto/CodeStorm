# Virtual Washing Machine üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: CodeStorm


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Meenakshy K M - Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Gloriya Titto - Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
The Virtual Washing Machine is a fun, interactive web application that simulates the washing process. Users can choose cloth types, set soap levels, and select water temperature while watching a realistic animated drum spin. It's a creative way to visualize washing machine operations with humor and interactivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We're solving the life-or-death issue of people not being able to watch their clothes spin online. In a world full of smart devices, we bravely tackle the global crisis of not having a virtual washing machine simulator. Because why do actual laundry when you can pretend to!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Virtual Washing Machine ‚Äî a completely unnecessary yet oddly satisfying web app that lets users simulate washing clothes. With spinning animations, customizable soap levels, and imaginary water temperatures, it offers absolutely zero help with your real laundry but 100% entertainment and front-end coding practice. Because sometimes, building something delightfully pointless is the best way to learn.

Interactive control panel of the Virtual Washing Machine, allowing users to select the type of clothes, adjust soap level with a slider, and choose water temperature. Functional buttons below trigger different washing stages ‚Äî Start Wash, Rinse, Spin, and Stop ‚Äî each paired with humorous labels for an engaging user experience.

Full interface of the Virtual Washing Machine web application. The UI features a central interactive drum button, dropdowns for selecting clothes type and water temperature, a soap level slider, and operation buttons (Start Wash, Rinse, Spin, Stop). Below, a status display humorously describes the wash state and user selections ‚Äî combining functional simulation with a playful user experience.

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/12V4q1yMuOeL2EyGZ-09Fcjvpbp3Lu45y/view?usp=drivesdk
The video showcases the Virtual Washing Machine in action. It demonstrates how users can interact with the interface by:

Selecting cloth type, soap amount, and water temperature using dropdowns and sliders.

Triggering different washing stages such as Start Wash, Rinse, Spin, and Stop.

Observing real-time status updates and animations (like the spinning drum), which simulate the operation of an actual washing machine in a fun, playful way.

The purpose of the video is to illustrate the project's interactivity, design, and humor-driven simulation, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
